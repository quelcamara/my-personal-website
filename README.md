## :computer: About the project
This is a website in a blog format  where I'll be constantly sharing knowledge about topics like Data Science, Machine Learning, and technology in the most general scenario. It is a very personal project and its main purpose is really to try to help people who are, just like me, starting a new career path. But not only them! Any person who wants to get into new matters or is just curious about Data Science might feel very welcome to visit the website.

My goal is to share with you, in a simple language, topics that people often get confused, and also many other curiosities! This way, any people, in any level or position, will be able to understand and assimilate the learning. I am very glad you got here and hope to see you there soon! ðŸ¤“
