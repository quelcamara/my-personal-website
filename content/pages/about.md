Welcome to the most beginner-friendly blog on **Data Science** you will ever see! Hope you are ready to go into the hotter topics on **Data Analysis**, **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Inteligence**, and so many other exciting stuff about technology and programming without getting all chaotic about those hard and complex book definitions.

So let us not take it too long!</br>
But first, let me introduce myself properly.

I am a former Designer and Civil Engineer who ended up falling in love with Data Science after a long time struggling to decide if I should keep on following the path I had once begun, or if I should just throw it all away and follow my heart into something I could finally see myself in. I know it might sound a little cheesy at some point, but that's what it is.  

I am a very curious person, and when I first dumped into Data Science, it was such a completely new world for me that I found myself unbearable amazed by the so many things I felt I just *needed* to know right away.

>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. <cite>Arthur C. Clarke</cite>

 So here we are!

When I decided I wanted to keep track of my progress I found that building a blog would be just the perfect beginning. That's because here I can not only keep my records about the things I am most recently studying, but I can also improve some communication skills, and - last but not least! - maybe I am able to help other people, in the near future, who are also starting their jorney into Data Science.

No changing of career is easy as it seems. It demands a lot of effort and resilience from you to start all over again. And that's why I am here! I hope this blog finds you in a perfect timing so you don't give up on following the path you've been dreaming.

*Be very welcome and enjoy your stay!* ðŸ’»
